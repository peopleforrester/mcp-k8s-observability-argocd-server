# ABOUTME: Resources package initialization for ArgoCD MCP Server
# ABOUTME: Reserved for future modularization of resource implementations

"""
ArgoCD MCP Resources Package (placeholder).

All MCP resource implementations currently reside in server.py:

    - argocd://instances: Lists configured ArgoCD instance URLs and projects
    - argocd://security: Exposes current safety mode (read-only, dry-run defaults)

This package is reserved for future modularization if server.py grows too large.
